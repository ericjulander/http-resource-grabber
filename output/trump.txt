In December 2015, Harold Bornstein, who had been Trump's personal physician since 1980, released a letter stating that Trump "will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".[86][87] Bornstein noted that Trump had an appendectomy at age 10, but did not mention the bone spurs that Trump said caused his medical deferment from the military at age 22.[17] A follow-up letter by Bornstein in September 2016 showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin to control cholesterol. In May 2018, Bornstein said that Trump himself had dictated the contents of the December 2015 letter,[88] and that three Trump representatives, including longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller, had taken away his medical records in February 2017.[89][90][why?]
On August 11, 2017, Trump said that he is "not going to rule out a military option" to confront the government of Nicolás Maduro.[751] In September 2018, Trump called "for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela" and said that "socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty."[752] On January 23, 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, as the interim president of Venezuela.[753]
Two of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy.[803][794] EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July 2018 amidst multiple investigations into his conduct,[804] while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned five months later as he also faced multiple investigations.[805]
